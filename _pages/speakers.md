These speakers will give an invited talk at SPIN 2024. More speakers and details about the talks will be announced on this page.

### [Kristin Yvonne Rozier](https://www.aere.iastate.edu/kyrozier/) (Iowa State University, USA)

Kristin Rozier is an Associate Professor in the faculty of the Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science Departments.
She previously worked at the University of Cincinatti and NASA.
Her research interests include various design-time formal methods for safety-critical (aerospace) systems, including model checking, runtime monitoring and LTL theory.

**Runtime monitoring and probabilistic falsification for effective human oversight**

This presentation introduces a framework that is meant to assist in
mitigating societal risks that software can pose. At its core, we
discuss a black-box analysis technique for identifying undesired effects
of software, based on a combination of runtime monitoring, probabilistic
falsification, and software doping analysis.

We discuss the potential of this framework in the context of high-risk
AI systems that are being used to evaluate humans in a possibly unfair
or discriminating way, in a spectrum from credit approval to judicial
decisions. We demonstrate how our approach can assist humans-in-the-loop
to make better informed and more responsible decisions. This aims to
promote effective human oversight, which for high-risk AI systems is a
central concept in the European Unionâ€™s upcoming AI Act. 

Holger Hermanns is Professor in the Dependable Systems and Software group at Saarland University.
His research interests include modeling and verification of concurrent systems, resource-aware embedded systems, compositional performance and dependability evaluation, and their applications to energy informatics. He is an outspoken proponent of proactive algorithmic accountability.
